It would be nice to have the formal metrics used with shortreads also use with long read data to see what they say.

LAP can take single-end reads - so actually it would be best to just let it align the long reads unscathed -- not turned into PE reads.
However, it does not give you enough control over Bowtie2 to toggle parameters to map reads with 15-30% error.
One can provide SAM files instead.
I found that this may be appropriate Bowtie2 parameters:
bowtie2 -D 20 -R 3 -N 1 -L 15 -i S,1,0.50 --score-min L,-1.5,-1.5 -x $BT2 -U R1.fastq 

Or if you do make them into PE reads (e.g. 500 bp reads from 2000 bp fragments)
bowtie2 -D 20 -R 3 -N 1 -L 15 -i S,1,0.50 --score-min L,-1.5,-1.5 -x $BT2 -1 R1.fastq -2 R2.fastq -X 3000


Other info:
BWA uses for ont2d,pacbio:
min seed = 14,17 -- blasr uses min seed of 12
discrd chain if seed bases shorter than = 20,40
look for internal seeds inside a seed longer than 10,10
+1 for match, -1 for mismatch, -1 for gap open, -1 for gap extend
-- above bowtie2 uses minseed of 15 -- mismtach -2/-6, gapopen -5, gapextend -3
--> b/c the fastq base qualities are low in general the mismatch will usually be around -3

Based on scoring method above, how many mismatches allowed?
This could allow 25-76 mismatches in a 100 bp read.
If we assume the mean base-quality is Q=10, this will allow 50-51 mismatches.
It would allow 30 gaps to open (and immediately close).
It would allow up to ~50 gap extends (assuming 1 gap open).

The bowtie2 approach above appears super slow.
Could use "bwa mem -x ont2d" with "-a" to report all alignments....



ALE:
Can do this with "single end" long reads -- i.e. no need to pair.
I got ale working on "bwa mem" alignments for pacbio only -- for some reason the ont alns did not work...
Nonetheless - though small N (2) - it seems the ALE score correlates with the other long read metrics I already use
..such as pct aln, ratio, and avg mapq of the alignments...


FRC:
Need to make PE reads from the long reads....
Need to map PE reads....


REAPR:
Need PE and basically need to use SMALT mapper with REAPR....
Need to understand SMALT a little better...
Tried perfect map -- that will not happen with error-prone shortFromLong reads...



Conclusions:
For now, ALE would be easiest to implement using same BWA mapping as for sniffles, but it is throwing an error on ONT alignments.
However, since the ALE score seems to fully agree with the summary metrics I already use and since it needs debugging for ONT alignments, for now I will not pursue combining ALE with long reads any further.
LAP could be performed using bwa mem with the -a option.
FRC could be done using PE sim reads sampled from long and mapped with BWA mem.
Since these programs require some more development for my automation scripts and more exploration to see how best to combine them with long reads, I will put this on hold.
REAPR might need a lot of exploration -- and needs to be put on hold for sure.
