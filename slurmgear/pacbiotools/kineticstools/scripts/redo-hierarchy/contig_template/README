- The only file that may need changes (in ultra-standard usage of this dir hierarchy for debugging):
	- create-config.sh
- Specifically - these variables have a high prob of needing manual editing:
	- ASMFASTA
		- Path to assembly under analysis
		- Should end w/ .fasta
	- KINETICSCRIPTS
		- This informs where to look for the path to the default kinetics-contigs.sh script for the TOPKC variable

- After editing create-config.sh, the only thing one should need to run in this directory is:
	- run-REDO.sh
- This will automatically run in this dir:
	- create-config.sh
	- run-kinetics-contig-nonKpipe-REDO.sh


- The top-level debug analysis just runs ipdSummary w/ a single worker.
	- typically TOPKC is the default kinetics-contigs.sh script

- All subdirs do different things and are already AUTOMATED to collect the variables they need

- When ready -- just launch run-all-debugs.sh
