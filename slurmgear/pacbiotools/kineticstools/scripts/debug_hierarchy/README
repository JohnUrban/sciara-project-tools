- Where to run:
	- Assumes you're in something like:	
	- ~/pathto/DirContainingEachAsmDir/AsmBaseNameDir/debug_hierarchy/

- USAGE:
- Copy entire debug_hierarchy into your working dir, cd into it, make mods/edits needed, run
	- bash run-all-contig-debugs.sh
- One can use "run-all-contig-debugs.sh" to 
	- create a subdir for each in a list of contigs 
		- copied exactly from contig_template/
	- run "run-all-debugs.sh" in each

- MANUAL EDITING THAT MAY BE NEEDED:
- Two points of order:
	- 1. Edit contignames.txt in THIS DIR to have 1 contig name per line (example given: contig_20)
	- 2. Since this script copies contig_template for every contig,
		- one only needs to follow instructions of README in contig_template before running this script over many contigs
		- The instruction in that README are re-iterated here as well

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTIG_TEMPLATE DIR
- The only file that may need changes (in ultra-standard usage of this dir hierarchy for debugging):
	- create-config.sh
- Specifically - these variables have a high prob of needing manual editing:
	- ASMFASTA
		- Path to assembly under analysis
		- Should end w/ .fasta
	- KINETICSCRIPTS
		- This informs where to look for the path to the default kinetics-contigs.sh script for the TOPKC variable

NOTE THIS IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY BY THE SCRIPT THAT ITERATES OVER CONTIGS
	- After editing create-config.sh, the only thing one should need to run in this directory is:
		- run-all-debugs.sh 
	- This will automatically run in this dir:
		- create-config.sh
		- run-kinetics-contig-nonKpipe-debug.sh
	- It will automatically go into each debug subdir and run:
		- run-kinetics-contig-nonKpipe-debug-SUBDIRs.sh
