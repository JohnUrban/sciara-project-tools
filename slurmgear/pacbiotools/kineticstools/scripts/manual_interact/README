- This is for running ipdSummary from the command-line -- not as a batch job
- It also takes the referenceWindows approach

- The only file that may need changes (in ultra-standard usage of this dir hierarchy for debugging):
	- create-config.sh

- Specifically - these variables have a high prob of needing manual editing:
	- ASMFASTA
		- Path to assembly under analysis
		- Should end w/ .fasta
	- KINETICSCRIPTS
		- This informs where to look for the path to the default kinetics-contigs.sh script for the TOPKC variable
	- REFWINDOWS
		- What contig/coordinates to analyze
