For an understanding of what this entire dir/subdir is about, read the README in template/ dir

For a given contig, feel free to cp -r only the template/ dir to your working dir and follow instructions therein.

Otherwise, for multiple contigs:
- cp -r this dir into your working dir
- Create a contig list file named names.txt in this dir

- EDIT the REF variable in create-config-and-launch.sh inside template subdir -- add the absolute path to the reference/assembly
	- Thus when this template directory is copied for all contigs, that variable is already in place.
- EDIT any of the other variables in the file above that will be shared amongst all contigs to avoid having to do this independently

- run: mk-all-contig-dirs.sh (in this dir)
	- This will just make a contig dir for all in that file
	- That is where the automation ends for this particular set up
- Go into each contig dir and follow the instructions in the README therein
