1. finish long read clean up - done

2. make bionano clean up - done

3. make various blast clean ups  - done

4. make rnaseq cleanups - done

5. fix follow up analyses....
add specified names to blast analyses -o in order to determine if a job is transcriptome, dmel, etc
--- done -- I think

6. longread stats -- need to restructure 
--> readstats when done mapping reads
--> sniffles states when done with sniffles
--> leave param file or touchfiles to represent if an analysis was done
--> can use those in followup value collection for tables....
if [ ! -z $A ]; then echo yes; fi
