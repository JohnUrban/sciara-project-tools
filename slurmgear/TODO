1. finish long read clean up - done

2. make bionano clean up - done

3. make various blast clean ups  - done

4. make rnaseq cleanups - done

5. fix follow up analyses....
add specified names to blast analyses -o in order to determine if a job is transcriptome, dmel, etc
--- done -- I think

6. longread stats -- need to restructure 
--> readstats when done mapping reads
--> sniffles states when done with sniffles
--> leave param file or touchfiles to represent if an analysis was done
--> can use those in followup value collection for tables....
if [ ! -z $A ]; then echo yes; fi

-- done-ish: 

7. run on canu vs falcon

8. begin updating longtable scripts....
shortread - need to get pilon info
longread - ignore combined, ignore lap, get reapr, frc, and ale info...
     - re-design how read info and sniffles info obtained
transcriptome - get blastn and tblastx results
dmel - get blastn, tblastx, and tblastn results
anoph - get blastn, tblastx, and tblastn results
known - get blastn results
rnaseq - get bt2 numbers, mapq info, pair info for 0 and 2....



9. make all genome asms 100% capital before beginning...
