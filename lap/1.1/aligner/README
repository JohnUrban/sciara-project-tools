calc_prob.py : Takes a set of reads and an assembly and generates
a list of probabilities representing the probability that a read
came from the assembly.
*********

IMPORTANT: Biopython, and bowtie2 must be in your PYTHONHOME and PATH envir.

TO RUN:

	./calc_prob.py -a genome.ctg.fasta [-q] -i input_1.fastq,input_2.fastq > output.probs

To see a full list of options, run ./calc_prob.py with no parameters.

calc_prob.py will generate bowtie2 indexes if no bt2 index is given.
Currently they are written by timestamp to ./indexes/temp_yy_mm_dd_HH_MM_SS
